# SmartFlood 2025

**Inventor**: Javii Trevino  
**AI Business Partner**: ChatGPT  
**Concept Name**: SmartFlood – AI-Driven Inflatable Flood Defense System

---

## Overview
SmartFlood 2025 is a breakthrough climate tech innovation that merges AI, home automation, and inflatable barrier technology to offer full-perimeter flood defense for residential homes. Designed to be trench-installed and invisible until activated, the system deploys instantly via mobile app or sensor-triggered AI, forming a watertight inflatable wall around your property.

## Key Features
- **AI-Controlled Deployment** (via app or sensor)
- **Trench-Housed Barrier** (hidden until flood detected)
- **Inflatable Perimeter Wall** (360° protection)
- **Modular & Repairable Sections**
- **Leak Detection Sensors**
- **Solar-Powered Backup**
- **Subscription-Based Maintenance System**

---

## How It Works
1. **Normal State**: SmartFlood remains concealed in perimeter trenches.
2. **Detection/Alert**: AI forecasts a flood or sensors detect rising water.
3. **Activation**: Triggers remote or auto inflation.
4. **Deployment**: Inflatable barriers rise and seal off the home.
5. **Post-Flood**: Auto-deflates, self-checks, and alerts for any damage.
