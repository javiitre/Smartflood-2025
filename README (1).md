## Common Grok Questions (And Suggested Answers)

**“Is it realistic and doable?”**  
Yes – if prototyped, it’s deployable within two years.

**“Would Elon Musk or Sam Altman fund this?”**  
Altman: Moderate to high likelihood.  
Musk: Low to moderate (unless tied to his ecosystem).

**“Where’s the code/data?”**  
[Placeholder: Upload prototype code or AI pipeline here.]

**“What makes this different?”**  
Combines home-scale barrier tech with AI prediction. No other project matches this scope + simplicity.
